You need to design a software system that educates and prepares schools/colleges to respond effectively during disasters (natural disasters, fires, earthquakes, floods, etc.).


Key Focus Areas:

Awareness & education (training modules, gamified learning, simulations)

Real-time alerts & notifications (SMS, mobile app, or in-app warning system)

Response guidelines (step-by-step instructions for students/teachers during emergencies)

Mock drills & assessment tracking (how prepared is the institution?)
