🗺️ Essential Steps for Project Development

🔹 Step 1: Research & Problem Understanding

Study past disasters in schools/colleges (fire outbreaks, earthquakes, building collapses, floods, etc.).

Research existing solutions like NDMA (National Disaster Management Authority) guidelines.

Identify gaps → e.g., lack of awareness, no digital education tools, slow response.

🔹 Step 2: Brainstorming Ideas

Ask yourself:

How can schools prepare before a disaster?

How can students respond during a disaster?

How can institutions recover after a disaster?

Map these into your system.

🔹 Step 3: Define Features

Possible innovative features:

Interactive learning modules: Videos, quizzes, AR/VR simulations.

AI-powered risk assessment: AI chatbot for disaster FAQs.

IoT integration: Smoke detector/earthquake alert integration.

Gamification: Students earn badges/certificates for completing safety drills.

Offline mode: App still works when internet is down.

🔹 Step 4: System Design

Make a high-level architecture:

Mobile/Web App for students & teachers.

Admin dashboard for schools & authorities.

Cloud-based backend for storing guidelines, drills, reports.

🔹 Step 5: Prototyping & Tech Stack

Frontend: ReactJS / Flutter (cross-platform mobile app).

Backend: Node.js / Django / Spring Boot.

Database: Firebase / PostgreSQL.

Cloud: AWS / Azure / GCP (can integrate disaster alert APIs).

Optional Add-ons: ARKit (iOS) or ARCore (Android) for simulations.

🔹 Step 6: Testing & Validation

Test with mock scenarios (fire alarm, earthquake drill).

Collect feedback → Improve usability, accessibility.
